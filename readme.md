**NOTE: this is a legacy release of the library**

The 0.3.x version (Experimental branch) is the preferred release for all users 
and is scheduled to be merged into the master branch in the near future. All new
development should start there.

There are a number of breaking API changes going from 0.2.x to 0.3.x. If you 
have an existing 0.2.x codebase that you are not ready to upgrade yet there is 
now a 0.2.x branch that will be maintained for that purpose.
